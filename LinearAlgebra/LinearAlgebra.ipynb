    "\n",
    "- **Data Representation**: Vectors and matrices are fundamental structures for representing datasets, with rows as samples and columns as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformations**: Linear algebra helps in applying geometric transformations (e.g., rotations, scaling), crucial for feature engineering and understanding data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) rely on linear algebra (eigenvectors/eigenvalues) to reduce the complexity of data while retaining its essence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Many machine learning models use optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) which are based on solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Operations in deep learning, such as computing weights and activations, are expressed as matrix multiplications and vector operations.\n",
